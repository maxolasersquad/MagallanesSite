<h2><a name="config-environment"></a>Configuring an Environment</h2>
<div>
    <p>
        Following the previous example we will edit the <strong>.mage/config/environments/production.yml</strong> file to configure the environment.
        <br />
        Let's see the sections of the configuration file and what we can setup there.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>deployment</h3>
        In the <strong>deployment</strong> section we configure how we copy the application.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>user</strong> - is the username used for the ssh connection.</li>
            <li><strong>from</strong> - is the location of the application, usually is the same directory where Magallanes is, but it could be any other path.</li>
            <li><strong>to</strong> - is the remote directory where the application is gonna be copied. If you are working with releases this shouldn&rsquo;t be the document root.</li>
            <li><strong>excludes</strong> - is a list of files and directories to exclude in the rsync. Magallanes always excludes the <em>.mage</em> and <em>.git</em> directories.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>hosts</h3>
        In the <strong>hosts</strong> section we configure a list of hosts (IPs or hostnames) to where the rsync will run against. You can also specify a port number like in the example above. Also, note that you should be able to do an SSH connection to the host using <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ssh+keys+without+passphrase" target="_blank">ssh keys without passphrase</a>, so you won't be requested any password.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>tasks</h3>
        In the <strong>tasks</strong> section we configure which tasks to run and when. You can look a complete list of built-in tasks <a href="#builtin-tasks">here</a>.
        <br />
        Each task is executed in the configured order and in a specific part of the deployment, these moments are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>pre-deploy</strong> - before deployments begins. Useful for vendor installation and scm update tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>on-deploy</strong> - executed on each host after the code has been copied. Useful for cache warmup, symlinks creations, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>post-release</strong> - executed on each host after the release has been executed.</li>
            <li><strong>post-deploy</strong> - after the deployment is completed. Useful for general tasks like cleanup of the cache system.</li>
        </ul>
        Here you can setup your own tasks. Bult in tasks <u>always</u> start with a namespace of the task type it belongs to (eg: scm, deployment, etc). On the other hand, custom tasks don't have a namespace.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>releases</h3>
        In the <strong>releases</strong> section we configure how releases will work for this environment. We will look at this configuration in the <a href="#releases">releases</a> section.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>locking</h3>
        When you run a deployment with Magallanes, all further deployments (for any other environment in that instance) are locked. This prevents multiple possible problems that you may experience, like different branches being deployed, a mix of vendors, etc. After the deployment is done, the lock is released.
    </p>

    <p>
        But sometimes you want to force locking the deployment to an environment, you can do this with the lock command.
    </p>

    <p class="bash">
        <span class="command-mage">mage</span> lock to:production
    </p>

    <p>
        This will lock all deployments to the <em>production</em> environment until you unlock it with the <em>unlock</em> command.
    </p>

    <p class="bash">
        <span class="command-mage">mage</span> unlock to:production
    </p>
</div>
